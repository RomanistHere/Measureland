### Why there are limits and how to deal with it.

You've encountered "Too many attempts" or "You rate too often" errors? Here we explain why and what to do.

<Summary
    text="In order to get an more ratings you'll need to write to us and tell your story, why you need it. Otherwise you'll get about 3-5 new ratings each week (works only if you have 0 left)."
    text2="If you spam login, reload the page too often or do other server related actions a lot in a short period of time, Measureland will stop being available for you for some time (usually 20 min)."
/>

### Why.

There are two different errors.

- <strong>"Too many attempts"</strong> stands for making a lot of requests (more than expected) to our server. If you spam like/dislike comments or reload the page 50 times within 10 minutes this error will popup. It protects our server from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack" class="article__link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">different types of attacks</a>. The system is not ideal though, so if you think you behaved normally and encountered this error, please, <a href="mailto:support@measureland.org" class="article__link">drop us</a> a short message how it happened, we will improve our system!
- <strong>"You rate too often"</strong> is a bit more complex. We expect some people abusing Measureland to profit. For example realtors who'd like to show how "great" some area is could easily rate 100 places with fives, spoiling the truth. That's why we can't let anyone without verification have an unlimited number of these ratings. Limitations are needed in order to be better. All Measuremen are going to get 3-5 new ratings every week (works only if 0 remaining).

### What to do.

- <strong>"Too many attempts"</strong>. This error doesn't depend on whether you passed verification or not. If you send more requests then we're expecting in the certain time range, service will stop working for you. Now you can take a break and wait a bit. 20 minutes should do it. If the issue persists, please, <a href="mailto:support@measureland.org" class="article__link">contact us</a> - we'll try to help.
- <strong>"You rate too often"</strong> issue could be resolved by applying to Measureland citizenship. <a href="mailto:support@measureland.org" class="article__link">Write to us</a> and shortly (1 - 2 sentences) note how much ratings you want and explain why. We use encrypted <a href="https://protonmail.com/" class="article__link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Protonmail</a>, make sure you trust your internet connection and email provider before telling important things.
