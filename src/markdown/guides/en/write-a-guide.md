### How to write.
There are a few key points while writing your own guide to remember.

We support only two languages for now: English and Russian - so we ask to write the guide using one of them. Ideally, we would like to see 2 copies, one in English and one in the local language. English version would be available right after the moderation and deployment, and the local one will be stored and deployed later.

We want the guide well-structured, please, make sure it's divided into logical instances, such as:

- General description of a city
- Short term rentals
- Long term rentals
- Buying a property
- Summary
- Other points to consider

Don't hesitate to be fun, alive - express yourself. Check other guides. We are going to place your article under your name/email (unless, you don't want to), Measuremen gonna love it!

### How to submit.
There are basically three main ways:

- <a href="mailto:support@measureland.org" class="article__link">Send us an email</a> with a pdf or doc or link to an online service. Please, don't copy-paste a plain text, it could be ruined.
- Open a new issue in <a href="https://github.com/RomanistHere/Measureland/issues" class="article__link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>. You'll need to have an account there.
- Familiar with HTML or Markdown? <a href="https://github.com/RomanistHere/Measureland/tree/master/blog" class="article__link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our blog structure</a> is super easy to understand, you'll see. Contribute!

### Rewards.
We are going to introduce a reward system later. Measuremen who found your article useful would be able to send their rewards to you, we also won't forget about your contribution!
