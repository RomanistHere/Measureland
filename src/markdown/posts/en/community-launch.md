We launched the community page ðŸ¥³ Why do we need it and what are our plans for it?

#### Reasons

To make decisions together. To share our thoughts on what's going on and get feedback. To make it easier to access how-to-be-involved information. Community is our driving force.

#### Current

Right now the page contains only most basic information, though it already allows you to easily submit your ideas or upvote some tasks you want us to focus on. And it's only the beginning.

#### Future

There are no certain plans. We can add some discussions Ã  la forum or the news/posts feed. Or we can add a place, where real-estate related spokesmen will answer daily questions from our users. Probably we'll be able to integrate community page deeper into the project or something else. We have a lot of possibilities. 

So if you wanted to influence what we do here - we would be more than happy. We'll try to make it more comfortable to participate in it from our side. For now that's it, visit us again, see ya.
