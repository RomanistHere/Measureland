### How to get it.
Right now we don’t have a fancy form, which you could fill with your query, though it’s probably on its way. For now we suggest you tell us your story directly via email: <a href="mailto:support@measureland.org" class="article__link">support@measureland.org</a> or leave your feedback/question/suggestion in our <a href="https://github.com/RomanistHere/Measureland/issues" class="article__link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> repository. But before you do, check the section just below.

### Bugs and errors.
- **"Too many attempts"** and **"You rate too often"** - <a href="../how-to-become-citizen/" class="article__link">how to resolve</a>.
- **"Nearby place is already rated by you"** - happens when you try to rate the place within a short distance from one already measured by you.
- **I can’t register because I don't get verification email or the service is unavailable/slow** - Measureland is in a sort of beta testing stage right now, means we don’t expect everything to work perfectly and stable. Some of the third-party providers (DigitalOcean, MailGun, etc.) are not configured for handling a lot of people, we're working on it. Don’t forget that all the work is mostly done by a single guy at this stage.
- **Something specific isn’t working, like map is not moving or zooming, register popup is not opening and so on** - to be extremely useful your report should include key points like:

    - **your browser and OS** (example: “Firefox, Windows laptop”);
    - **description of the problem** (example: “Can't open register popup”);
    - **if the problem persists (after reload), what are the steps to reproduce it** - ideally with screenshots or video (example: “click side menu at the right top corner → click on the login button → click “I want to register” button → nothing happens)

### FAQ.
- **How Measureland protected from spam and abuse?** - we have a few levels of protection, including <a href="../how-to-become-citizen/" class="article__link">different limitations</a> and server-side hardware detections. We are going to continue working on this part, it's important to be as trustworthy as possible.
- **Do you plan to add new features?** - we most certainly do! Measureland is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) right now - means there is only basic functionality right now - and we have the list of features we can't wait to add. **Could you share some?** - we will later :)
- **You claim yourself non-commercial, non-profit-oriented - how did you come up with it and why are there paid options?** - there are too much "commerce" in this world right now. <a href="https://stallman.org/facebook.html" class="article__link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Most popular services</a> in the world are oriented to get maximum profit from everything even if it <a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/" class="article__link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can harm its users</a>. We do literally hate to see it. Measureland is designed as a counterweight to this. Check <a href="../about-us/" class="article__link">the about-us page</a> for more. Paid options are needed to make our feature possible. We would like an opportunity to hire designers and developers, get faster servers - it's hardly possible without money.
- **How can I help?** - there are numerous ways to do it, here are some important ones (<a href="mailto:support@measureland.org" class="article__link">support@measureland.org</a> - don't hesitate to ask us about or clarify anything via email):
