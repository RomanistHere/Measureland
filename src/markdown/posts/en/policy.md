### We believe in Users-are-not-for-sale web.
Here we describe what we do with your data in the vastness of Measureland.

<Summary
    text="We are collecting and storing only the data you provide us with (plus a few technical things) and using within our service only. No selling."
/>

### What do we collect?
- **Information you provide.** Measureland is based on user reviews. Parts of reviews are: ratings, comments, locations - we store it (and display it to other users) on our servers as well as components of user profile: username, email, letters you send to us and so on.
- **Some of your actions.** By this statement we leave an opportunity to collect some service usage information, but we generally prefer to not track or collect any user actions.
- **Technical details.** We may collect some information about the network connection and hardware.

### How do we use what we collect?
- **Share your reviews with users of Measureland.** Since our service is based on reviews, it’s essential that we allow other users to see information submitted by you. You can affect other users' reviews, so can they.
- **Communicate with you through email.** We can send you letters once you provide us with your email address. We won’t spam. It’s needed to verify users, prevent abuses, notify about important changes and so on.
- **Process, analyze, improve, impact the world.** With the growth of the Measureland there could appear opportunities to make the world a better place. We may conduct research. Also analyzing different sorts of data can help us improve our service in a non-countable number of ways.
- **Protect service/users from threats.** Collecting technical details like IP-addresses can help us to prevent different sorts of attacks.

### Do we use cookies?
**We may.** In our case they are used for smoother user experience or not used at all. In any case, we don’t store any valuable data there.

### Do we sell or share your data with anyone?
**No.** We don’t sell users data to anyone or use any third-party technologies that could do it. If you think that third-party we use went down a crooked path, please, <TextLink href="mailto:support@measureland.org" text="contact us" />.

### How is the service being supported then?
**Measureland is financed by its developer RomanistHere (Roman Smunyov).** We don’t intend to make money from it, though in the future we can announce some monetization strategy. If you want to support our project, we're are on <TextLink href="https://opencollective.com/measureland" blank={true} text="Open Collective" /> - it's the most transparent way to do so.

### Are we going to change this policy?
**Probable.** Growth of the service could lead to changes, but don’t worry, we will notify you before it happens (in case of major changes) via email.

### What about child privacy?
**Measureland is not intended for children under 13 years of age.** We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13, please do not provide any information in Measureland.
