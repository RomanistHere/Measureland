## We believe in mutually honest relationships.
By entering Measureland lands (using a web-app) I (user) confirm that I read, understand and am going to follow all the laws (rules) below.

We're not to be associated with any sort of political instance. "Government", "constitution", "citizen" and other official words are used to make the user experience more ambient and interesting.

### Measureland Laws and Advises.
- **User data and privacy are extremely valuable for the Measureland authorities.** Such things are not for sale. <TextLink href="../policy/" text="See our policy" />.
- **We do not produce a social hierarchy in the vastness of Measureland.** One can’t buy something others can’t have free.
- **Inappropriate behavior (one that can harm other people) can be punished.** For the whole list of illegal activities, email: <TextLink href="mailto:support@measureland.org" text="support@measureland.org" />. Unclear cases can be resolved at the assembly.
- **Trustworthy.** Measureland is driven by community, which means we can't guarantee that all the ratings and comments other Measuremen leave are true - these are opinions - though it should give you an idea about what is happening.
- **We encourage everyone to participate in the formation of Measureland.** Our code base is <TextLink href="https://github.com/RomanistHere/Measureland" blank={true} text="open-source" /> - we would like to invite you to improve the existing regime, help to build a new one or at least leave feedback. Every citizen is responsible for the whole nation.
- **Monetizing is not the goal.** Some sorts of relevant ("moving in" or "rent apartment" services, for example) advertisements can be integrated, but people will always be a priority number one.
- **Status.** There are two legal statuses (and levels of limitations) one can have in Measureland right now:

    - **Visitor.** The only available thing to do is to check ratings and comments left by other people.
    - **Permanent Resident.** Right after one verifies his email. 3-5 Available ratings from start. Also, there are 3 - 5 new places to rate every week plus possibility to like/dislike comments, <TextLink href="../../community/" text="vote for new features" /> and so on...
- **Other limitations.** It's a standard practice for web services to limit the number of uses. It exists to protect service and its users from different types of attacks. For example, if you refresh your page an unexpectedly big number of times during downloading of map and data, service will stop being available for you for some period of time. We have reasons to expect some minor dishonesty in Measureland, but we will try to keep the level of it as low as possible. Most of the changes you can do are somehow limited. If you accidentally triggered yourself as a suspect, please, <TextLink href="mailto:support@measureland.org" text="contact us" />.
- **Third-party.** By agreeing to our terms of use, you're agreeing to third-party technologies terms of use, Measureland is built with, like <TextLink href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" blank={true} text="OpenStreetMap" /> or <TextLink href="https://leafletjs.com/" blank={true} text="Leaflet" />. Here's <TextLink href="https://github.com/RomanistHere/Measureland/wiki/Privacy-of-3rd-party-tools" blank={true} text="a full list" /> of third-party tools we use that can collect/process some parts of data.
- **Intellectual property.** Everything except third-party technologies (codebase, functionality, images, design) is created by RomanistHere (Roman Smunyov) and is his intellectual property. If you believe that your intellectual property rights have been infringed upon or have a question related to using our functionality - <TextLink href="mailto:support@measureland.org" text="contact us" />
- **Commercial and non-commercial use.** If you're going to use data or some functionality for your purposes, you should know that it's free for non-commercial use, though we'd like you to point us out as an origin. Commercial use is discussed for every case - <TextLink href="mailto:support@measureland.org" text="drop us a message" />, we'll figure it out.
- **We may collect some data.** It's covered in <TextLink href="../policy/" text="our policy" />. At some point in the future we will likely remove or make it optional, but at the beginning it's important to see how our service is being used.
