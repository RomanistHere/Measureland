### Why there are limits and how to deal with it.
You've encountered "Too many attempts" or "You rate too often" errors? Here we explain why and what to do.

<Summary
    text="To protect Measuremen from spam and abuse, we manually review cases where someone needs more then 3-5 ratings per week. If you're this «someone», contact us, we will resolve it"
    text2="Spamming buttons, reloading the page too often or doing other server related actions a lot in a short period of time will lead to Measureland not being available for you for some time (usually 20 min)."
/>

### Why.
There are two different errors.

- **"Too many attempts"** stands for making a lot of requests (more than expected) to our server. If you spam like/dislike comments or reload the page 50 times within 10 minutes this error will popup. It protects our server from <TextLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack" blank={true} text="different types of attacks" />. The system is not ideal though, so if you think you behaved normally and encountered this error, please, <TextLink href="mailto:support@measureland.org" text="drop us" /> a short message, we will fix it and improve our system!
- **"You rate too often"** is a bit more complex. We expect some people abusing Measureland to profit. For example realtors who'd like to show how "great" some area is could easily rate 100 places with fives, spoiling the truth. That's why we can't let anyone without verification have an unlimited number of our ratings. Limitations are needed in order to be better. All Measuremen are going to get 3-5 new ratings every week (currently works only if 0 remaining).

### What to do.
- **"Too many attempts"**. This error doesn't depend on whether you passed verification or not. If you send more requests then we're expecting in the certain time range, service will stop working for you. Now you can take a break and wait a bit. 20 minutes should do it. Or you can <TextLink href="mailto:support@measureland.org" text="contact us" /> - we'll try to help.
- **"You rate too often"** issue could be resolved by sending us a message <TextLink href="mailto:support@measureland.org" text="via email" />, <TextLink href="https://t.me/MeasurelandBot" blank={true} text="Telegram" /> or <TextLink href="https://discord.gg/PBrXUhqJhC" blank={true} text="in Discord" /> and tell us how much ratings you need. Once we see it and review, we'll be more than happy to increase your number of available ratings so you can share your experience with us.
