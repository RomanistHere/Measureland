                By entering Measureland lands (using a web-app) I (user) confirm that I read, understand and am going to follow all the laws (rules) below.
            </p>

                We're not to be associated with any sort of political instance. "Government", "constitution", "citizen" and other official words are used to make the user experience more ambient and interesting.

                    <strong class="article__strong">Other limitations.</strong> It's a standard practice for web services to limit the number of uses. It exists to protect service and its users from different types of attacks. For example, if you refreshed your page an unexpectedly lot number of times during downloading of map and data, service would stop being available for you for some period of time. We have reasons to expect some minor dishonesty in Measureland, but we will try to keep the level of it as low as possible. Most of the changes you can do are somehow limited.
