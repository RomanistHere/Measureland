                You've encountered "Too many attempts" or "You rate too often" errors? Here we explain why and what to do.
            </p>

            <h3 class="article__heading">
                Why.
            </h3>

            <p>
                There are two different errors.
            </p>

            <ul class="article__list article__list-simple">
                <li class="article__item">
                    <strong class="article__strong">"Too many attempts"</strong> stands for making a lot of requests (more than expected) to our server. If you spam like/dislike comments or reload the page too often this error will popup. It protects our server from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack" class="article__link" target="_blank">different types of attacks</a>. The system is not ideal though, so if you think you behaved normally and encountered this error, please, drop us a short message how it happened, we will improve our system!
                </li>
                <li class="article__item">
                    <strong class="article__strong">"You rate too often"</strong> is a bit more complex. We expect some people abusing Measureland to profit. For example realtors who'd like to show how "great" some area is could easily rate 100 places with fives, spoiling the truth. That's why we can't let anyone without "real" (ID for now) verification have an unlimited number of these ratings. Limitations are needed in order to be better.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="article__heading">
                What to do.
            </h3>

            <ul class="article__list article__list-simple">
                <li class="article__item">
                    <strong class="article__strong">"Too many attempts"</strong>. This error doesn't depend on whether you passed verification or not. If you send more requests then we're expecting in the certain time range, service will stop working for you. Now you can take a break and wait a bit. 20 minutes should do it. If the issue persists, please, <a href="mailto:RomanistHere@pm.me" class="article__link">contact us</a> - we'll try to help.

                <li class="article__item">
                    <strong class="article__strong">"You rate too often"</strong> issue could be resolved by applying to Measureland citizenship. <a href="mailto:RomanistHere@pm.me" class="article__link">Send your ID to us</a> and shortly (1 - 2 sentences) note how much ratings you want and explain why.
