                We will try to form a little world, where it doesn't matter if you have money or not. You will have access to everything anyway. And will try to combine it with making some money to support Measureland itself.

                        I didn’t make this service profit-oriented. I don’t plan to monetize it with annoying ads and so on. All I tried was to solve a problem and help people. Nevertheless, money is a motivation to continue, as well as an opportunity to make further developments full time - I’d like that and I’d appreciate your help a lot. #Crypto.
