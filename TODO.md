# To do:

- add anchors in articles where needed

# With the next release

- write to wiki with questions about development and monetization.
- add measureland to my projects in portfolio
- write to everyone!
- send why-svelte article to svelte community
- set the dates on the contest

# Later

- link communities based on city/country
- telegram bot
- ask users to highlight areas in the city with something nice, like best quality of water
- https://leafletjs.com/examples/map-panes/

# Stuff to remember and check later

- Content security policy. Svelte should introduce something to remove script and css 'unsafe-inline' property with the release.
