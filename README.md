## Contributing

Useful features, cool technologies ("hi Svelte!"), new ideas - the project is unique and doesn't have alternatives (at the moment of writing), we want to solve some of problems we all face every day - let's do it together, jump in! More then 10 people have shown their interest already.

We can think of 4 main ways of contributions:
- **Code itself.** SvelteKit, MongoDB, ExpressJS, algorithms, map optimizations, a lot of data - truly vaporous area to improve your skills or achieve new ones!
- **How-to-rent-in-your-city guide.** If you have experience of searching for a place in your town recently, it'd be extremely useful for everyone if you shared it. Check out the [existing guides](https://measureland.org/blog) and use the [template](blog/minsk-belarus)
- **Design and images.** We want to improve our visual thing as well, so your ideas/designs/images are welcome
- **Feedback.** We need it :)

## Getting started on programming

There is a guide on how to start back-end server inside back-end folder README.

We use #Svelte for front-end, links: [tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial), [documentation](https://svelte.dev/docs). SvelteKit for building: [documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs)
We suggest to name branches this way:

- **fix/something-bad** - for bug fixes
- **feat/something-good** - for new features
- **chore/update-something** - refactor

All branches go to/from master and applied by pull requests with reviews.
