## Contributing

**Important** Right now we're migrating the project to Svelte in another branch

We can think of 3 ways we'd like to see contributions about:
- **Code itself.** Since the project is in MVP stage, best programming practices weren't the goal, however after the release it becomes more important. Improvements, fixes, new technologies (something more functional, not OOP) - it's a truly vaporous area to code.
- **How-to-rent-in-your-city guide.** If you have this experience, it'd be extremely useful for everyone if you shared it. Check out the [existing guides](https://measureland.org/blog) and use the [template](blog/minsk-belarus)
- **Design and images.** We want to improve our visual thing as well, so your ideas/designs/images are welcome

There is a guide on how to start back-end server inside back-end folder README.

We suggest to name branches this way: **fix/something-bad** - for bug fixes, **feat/something-good** - for new features, **chore/update-something** - for refactorings. All branches go to/from master and applied by pull requests with reviews.
