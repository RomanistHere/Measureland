                <p>
                    Register and verify your email to measure land. Evaluate every point in the quiz, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd" class="article__link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it's important</a>. Comments can be extremely useful.

            <h3 class="article__heading">
                So you want to rate a place.
            </h3>

            <p class="article__p">
                To do so you need to be registered and logged in. Once you're ready, find the area you want to measure and click it. There is no need to be super accurate, there is no goal to rate every building in the world. More like to get a general vision of every neighborhood, block and district.
            </p>

            <p class="article__p">
                There are 11 points you need to measure in order to submit your rating. It's important to rate every one of them even if you're not sure. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd" class="article__link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Take a wild guess!</a>
            </p>

            <p class="article__p">
                The last three points are marked as additional. They aren't that significant and have lower value in the final rating. But some of us are going to find it useful, so evaluate it as well.
            </p>

            <p class="article__p">
                Comments are not necessary but can be extremely useful. We plan to reward the most helpful comments in the future.
            </p>


            <h3 class="article__heading">
                I can't!
            </h3>

            <p class="article__p">
                There are a few reasons you can't rate a place. There should be an error indicating what's wrong. For example:
            </p>

            <ul class="article__list article__list-simple">
                <li class="article__item">
                    <strong class="article__strong">"Too many attempts"</strong> or <strong class="article__strong">"You rate too often"</strong> are about exceeding the limits of usage. See <a href="../how-to-become-citizen/" class="article__link">how to resolve</a> these issues.
                </li>
                <li class="article__item">
                    <strong class="article__strong">"Nearby place is already rated by you"</strong> happens when you try to rate the place within a short distance from one already measured by you.
                </li>
                <li class="article__item">
                    <strong class="article__strong">In other cases it's most likely our bad.</strong> We're sorry. Read the error description, try to reload the page or check it later.
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h3 class="article__heading">
                Share it.
            </h3>

            <p class="article__p">
                You can easily get the link to the rating by clicking "Share this rating" or copying the URL. URL will always depend on the location you see on the screen.
            </p>

            <p class="article__p">
                There is also a possibility to highlight and share areas on the map, more about it below.
            </p>


            <h3 class="article__heading">
                Drawing tools
            </h3>

            <p class="article__p">
                Since the 1.1.0 version it's possible to draw shapes on the map and then share results. There are three types of shapes right now: polygon, rectangle and circle. You can find it at the right bottom corner of the screen (three top buttons respectively). You'll find the tips on how to draw once you click any of it. There are two more buttons below: edit and delete.
            </p>

            <p class="article__p">
                After every action your URL is going to change, so if you reload your page, shapes will remain - you can copy your address and share it with someone, he's gonna see exactly the same view as you do. For now it can be very big and ugly, but we're working on it.
            </p>

            <p class="article__p">
                There is a limit for URLs, 2000 characters, so once you achieve it, you will see a message that will ask you to remove some shapes in order to be able to share it. You can continue to draw, though.
            </p>
